Combined Sewer Overflows (CSOs), according to the Massachusetts Department of Environmental Protection, were built as part of sewer collection systems that were designed to carry both sewage and stormwater in the same pipe. When there is not a lot of stormwater, this mix is transported to a wastewater treatment plant where it is processed. However, after heavy rainfall or snowmelt, stormwater and sewage overload the system. Without CSOs, the mix would back up into homes, businesses, and public streets. The regulator structures in these overflow systems divert extra waste water into rivers, lakes and coastal areas, effectively compromising the area's water quality.",
